# Deciphering_Protein_Sequence_Relationships

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and comparing the sequences of two significant human proteins: Human Serum Albumin (HSA) and Human Actin, Alpha Skeletal Muscle. By utilizing Python-based tools and bioinformatics resources such as BLAST, SWISS-MODEL, and InterProScan, we aim to uncover insights into the functional, structural, and evolutionary aspects of these proteins.

## Objectives
- **Unveil Functional Domains:** Identify and analyze critical regions that influence protein functionality and interactions.
- **Predict Protein Structures:** Use SWISS-MODEL to predict 3D structures and gain structural insights essential for drug development.
- **Explore Evolutionary Connections:** Compare protein sequences across species to understand their evolutionary history and significance.

## Tools and Methods
- **BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool):** Used for sequence alignment to identify conserved regions and functional domains.
- **SWISS-MODEL:** Employed for predicting 3D structures based on protein sequences.
- **InterProScan:** Annotates protein sequences, identifying domains, motifs, and functional sites.
- **Python Libraries:** NumPy and Pearson's r for statistical analysis, focusing on the correlation between amino acid compositions.

## Key Features
- **Sequence Alignment:** Detailed comparative analysis of HSA and Actin sequences to pinpoint similarities and differences.
- **3D Structure Prediction:** Visualization and analysis of predicted protein structures.
- **Evolutionary Analysis:** Investigating evolutionary relationships across species, revealing functional adaptations.

## Results
- **Functional Regions:** Identified essential regions crucial for protein functionality, offering potential targets for drug development.
- **Structural Insights:** Predicted 3D structures providing a foundation for drug design and protein engineering.
- **Evolutionary Linkages:** Close evolutionary relationships between HSA and Actin, highlighting shared functional traits.
